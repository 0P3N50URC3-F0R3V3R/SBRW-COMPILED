To use the Launchers you need to edit the files in the domains\ subfolder,
to point to your server.

you need to edit:
cert_domain.txt 
file_domain.txt 
main_domain.txt 
ModNet.txt 
static.txt 
static_alt.txt 

The github ones only needed if you are gonna use own version hosted on github
otherwise, leave them as it is.
