This is based on the nightriderz server livemap, with a whiff of modifications of the freeroam server.

Currently the only working part is that it shows drivers in freeroam mode, and
colors if someone in the admins.json with pink.

The territories, and the event maps (races) are just static, it needs database rewrite, 
and customisation. it is not reflectin the actual db with the game.

This is a work in progress, but you can use the freeroam map. 

There is some expressions in hungarian, but just a few, you can translate it back to english if you want.

TO MAKE THIS WORK YOU NEED TO COPY FREEROAMD.exe from the archive and replace to your original freeroamd.exe,
and edit index.php in livemap and edit the line where the ws:// is to your sever. You might want to open the FMS port.

ALL THING WORK IN PROGRESS!!
