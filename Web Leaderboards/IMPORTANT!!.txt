These are prototype and early access!! Still working on it, not production ready.

Theese leaderboard php files will list only existing records, so if there is a
map that has no record on it or never played on it anyone, it will be not shown 
until it has a valid time and played by a player persona.

This is a very basic stuff with few datas, the goal is that having a webpage side
of profile, and leaderboards and ranks on the private server.

it requires php7 and mysql8.
