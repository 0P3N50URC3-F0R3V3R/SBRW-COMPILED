# SBRW Core

## About/Overview
The **soapbox-race-core** project is focused on developing a game server compatible with the game **Need for Speed:

## Technical details
The server is an application built to run on the [Wildfly](https://wildfly.org) platform, through [Thorntail](https://thorntail.io). Maven is used as the build
system. All code is written for Java 8.

## Installation
Installation documentation is WIP.
